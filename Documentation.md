GENERAL APPROACH

Designing a Conversational Dream Analysis Chatbot: A Research Proposal


**Abstract:** 
    Dreams have long fascinated humankind, offering glimpses into our subconscious and potentially revealing hidden 
truths about ourselves. Dream analysis has been practiced for centuries, but the advent of artificial intelligence and 
natural  language processing (NLP) presents an exciting opportunity to develop automated systems capable of interpreting dreams. This research proposal explores the design of a conversational dream analysis chatbot that leverages advanced NLP techniques to provide users with insightful and nuanced interpretations.


**Introduction:**

    Dreams are complex and often elusive experiences, their meanings open to diverse interpretations. Traditional dream analysis methods often rely on subjective interpretations by experts or standardized dream dictionaries, which may not capture the unique context and individual significance of a specific dream. This research aims to address these limitations by developing a conversational dream analysis chatbot that utilizes advanced NLP techniques to provide users with personalized and accurate interpretations.

**Literature Review:**

    Existing research on dream analysis has explored various approaches, from Jungian and Freudian interpretations to cognitive and neurobiological perspectives. However, few studies have focused on the application of NLP in automated dream analysis. A handful of research projects have explored using machine learning algorithms to classify dreams based on specific themes or emotions, but these approaches often lack the depth and nuance required for personalized interpretations.
